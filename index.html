        <p>Hello, my name is Hermilio Mota. I was born in Brazil, but I am currently living in Portugal.
            I enjoy embracing new cultures, and living in Portugal has given me the opportunity to grow personally and
            professionally while staying connected to my Brazilian roots.
            I am passionate about learning, improving myself, and exploring new ideas—especially in areas related to
            technology and development.
            I'm always looking for ways to evolve, contribute to meaningful projects, and build connections with people
            from different backgrounds.
            Thank you for getting to know a little about me!</p>
